## TODO:

From the list of requirements, I still have to:

 - [ ] Add a few more tests. Mostly integration, on TodoItem and RecycledTodoItem.
 - [ ] Improve JSDoc types.

As the task is to create a relatively simple ToDo app, there are a few things I would improve/add on top: 

 - [ ] Add LocalStorage fallback for browsers that have it blocked (Safari sometimes does this).
 - [ ] Allow selecting multiple items at once
 - [ ] Add cross tab support
 - [ ] Improve design - its not the prettiest thing
 - [ ] Improve accessibility - have not focused on it at all
 - [ ] Add keyboard only navigation support
 - [ ] Categorizing and Filtering (Category, Date, Status, Content search)
 - [ ] Allow completing all visible items and vice versa. (would go well with above)
 - [ ] Integrate with an API for extended features. 
 - [ ] Could allow anonymous usage via LocalStorage and API integration for logged-in users.
 - [ ] Add offline support (PWA).
